//! The `webhook-signature` auth for busbar: its logic and its door.

//! One door, two ways in: a busbar build that links this crate names the door here; the sibling
//! `busbar-auth-webhook-signature-plugin` cdylib exports the same door as its image's one symbol (`export_door!`). This crate
//! exports nothing. Write the door with the `auth` kind's SDK in `busbar_contract::abi::sdk`.
